KitGUI is an injectable content management tool that works on any server-side that can support REST. 
KitGUI's primary purpose is to be an easy way to inject CMS as needed and as painlessly as possible to any existing dynamic website.

This is the API for KitGUI to facilitate the persistence of content and to authenticate/authorize user access.
